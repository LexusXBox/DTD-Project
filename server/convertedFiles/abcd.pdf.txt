The following clauses set out the ways in which this Agreement may be brought to an 
end by either party.  In addition, these clauses set out the procedures which the Tenant 
or Landlord shall use when the Tenancy is brought to an end.   
 
It is agreed between the Landlord and Tenant as follows: 
 
1. Ending the Tenancy and Re-entry 
1.1. If at any time: 
1.1.1. the  Rent,  or  any  part  of  it  remains  unpaid  for  14  days  after  falling  due,  whether 
formally demanded or not; or 
1.1.2. if any agreement or obligation of the Tenant is not complied with; or 
1.1.3. if any of the grounds set out in Schedule 2 of the Housing Act 1988 (as amended) 
being grounds 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 or 17 are made out (see Definitions);

statutory  obligations;  obtaining  a  court  order;  and re-entering  the  Premises  with  the 
County Court Bailiff.  When the Bailiff enforces a possession order the right for the Tenant

the Landlord may have in respect of the Tenant’s obligations under this Agreement. 
 
2. Early Termination 
2.1. If the Tenant vacates the Premises during the Term apart from according to any agreed 
break clause which is included within the Agreement, the Tenant will remain liable to pay 
Rent and any other monies payable under this Agreement until the Term expires; or the 
Premises are re-let whichever is earlier.

insurance monies are not recoverable (whether in whole or in part) because of any thing

re-housing the Tenant. To avoid doubt between the parties the Landlord has no obligation

known  address  of  the  Landlord  if  different;  and  reasonable  evidence  is  kept  of  the

Custodial Schemes were established in England and Wales under the Housing Act 2004. 
They are open to any person or organisation taking Deposits for a residential Tenancy. 
Under our Custodial Scheme, when a Landlord, Letting Agent or Organisation receives a 
Deposit from a Tenant, they pass the money to us for safekeeping.
Customer Service Centre
This is our telephone contact centre. You can contact the Customer Service Centre on 
0330 303 0033 between 8am and 6.30pm on Working Days. Our Customer Service 
Centre closes on bank holidays in England and Wales. Please check the homepage of 
our website for details.
Decision 
This is the evidence-based decision of an Adjudicator made in relation to a Dispute in 
accordance with these Terms and Conditions.
Deposit
This is the money a Tenant gives to their Landlord under the Tenancy Agreement, who 
then pays it to us for safe keeping. The Deposit is used as security against breach of 
the Tenant’s obligations under the Tenancy Agreement, for example failure to keep the 
Property in good repair and failure to pay the rent.
Deposit ID
This is the unique identifying reference number allocated to a Deposit following the 
successful submission of the Deposit to us. 
Dispute 
If at the end of a Tenancy, the Landlord and the Tenant cannot agree on how much of 
the Deposit should be given to each Party, this is a Dispute.
Dispute Resolution Service
Our Dispute Resolution Service is an independent service we provide to resolve Disputes 
and is a free alternative to going to court. If you use our Dispute Resolution Service, we 
will collate and summarise evidence provided by each person involved in the Dispute 
and one of our Adjudicators will review the evidence and make a Decision on how much 
of the Deposit should go to each Party.

3. How our Custodial Scheme works
Our Custodial Scheme is free to use (with some exceptions, explained later in these 
Terms and Conditions) and is open to all Landlords. Below is an overview of how 
it works.
a.  After taking a Deposit from a Tenant, the Landlord must protect the Deposit within 
30 Calendar Days of receiving it in order to avoid the consequences set out in the 
Housing Act 2004. We will accept Deposits submitted after 30 Calendar Days.
b.  Once we have protected a Deposit, we will send confi rmation to the Landlord, the Tenant 
and any Relevant Person (see section 12 for details about what we send). The Landlord 
must also give the Prescribed Information to the Tenant. Landlords can print a Prescribed 
Information form which is pre-populated with the information they have entered into 
the Landlord’s online account at www.depositprotection.com. The Landlord will need to 
provide additional information to complete the Prescribed Information.
c.  At the end of the Tenancy, the Landlord and Tenant should try to agree how much of 
the Deposit should be paid to the Landlord, Tenant or the Relevant Person (if there is 
one). If the Parties can agree, the Landlord and Tenant must confi rm the following on 
their repayment Forms or online submissions:
 i.   the amount of the Deposit that should be repaid to the Landlord with reasons; and
 ii.    the amount of the Deposit that should be repaid to the Tenant with reasons.
d.  If the Landlord and the Tenant agree, we will pay out the amount the Landlord and 
Tenant agree should be repaid to each of them as detailed on the repayment Form or 
online submission. 
e.  If there is a Dispute regarding the repayment of part or all of the Deposit, it will be referred 
to our Dispute Resolution Service, unless we are instructed otherwise in writing.
f.  If one Party instructs us that they do not wish to use the Dispute Resolution Service, 
the Deposit will be suspended until we are notifi ed that both Parties do wish to use 
the Dispute Resolution Service, or we are informed that the Parties have reached 
agreement as to distribution of the Deposit, or we are presented with a court order 
relating to repayment of the Deposit in accordance with section 24. 
g.  The Landlord or Tenant may follow the Statutory Declaration Process if they have no 
current address for the other Party or if the other Party fails to respond to a written 
notice from the claiming Party claiming some or all of the Deposit within 14 Calendar 
Days of the date of the notice.
4. Ways to contact us 
a. The Online Service
 i.   Landlords  can  register  online  and  anyone  using  our  Service  can  complete

protection either online through their account at www.depositprotection.com or with 
a Cheque Deposit Submission Form sent to us by post.

Days of receipt from the Tenant.

been provided. 
d.  Landlords can increase the amount of an existing Deposit at any time during the Tenancy. 
e.  If Landlords create a Tenancy profi le but do not submit a Deposit for protection within 
60 Calendar Days, we will cancel the Tenancy profi le and Landlords will need to create

11.   Payment options
a. The Landlord must ensure that they pay the correct amount of Deposit to us.  
b. Deposits can be paid to us by bank transfer, debit card or cheque.
I. Bank Transfers 
a.  Bank transfer payments can only be used for online custodial Deposit submissions 
and must be made using our 6 digit sort code and the Landlord’s unique 8 digit 
account number which will be displayed when a Landlord opts to pay by Bank transfer 
in their online account. Landlords must add a reference number to the payment. 
b.  Payments we receive can be allocated to custodial Deposits manually or automatically. 
Automatic allocation will only occur if the amount paid exactly matches a custodial 
Deposit  awaiting  payment  and/or  the  reference  number  on  the  Landlord’s  bank 
transfer matches the reference specifi ed by the Landlord. If for any reason we are 
unable to match a payment to a Deposit, then the funds will be credited to the 
Landlord’s account for the Landlord to allocate manually.
c.  If manual allocation is required, the Landlord must log in to their online account and 
manually allocate the submitted funds to the relevant custodial Deposit. It is the 
Landlord’s sole responsibility to manually allocate funds in order to ensure that the 
Deposit is protected.
d.  Bank Transfers are non-reversible. If you think that an over-payment has been made, 
then you must contact us on 0330 303 0033 or by completing an online enquiry form, 
available on www.depositprotection.com.

of £25.89 which the Landlord must pay. Until this fee is paid, we won’t accept any

Landlord should contact us with reasonable supporting evidence to confi rm this.
c.  If  an  incoming  Landlord  contacts  us  with  reasonable  supporting  evidence  which 
suggests that the Landlord of the Tenancy has changed, we will contact the outgoing 
Landlord to confi rm this, giving them 7 Calendar Days to respond. If the outgoing 
Landlord does not call us at the Customer Service Centre on 0330 303 0033 within 7 
Calendar Days, we will transfer the Tenancy to the incoming Landlord.

Deposit for the Tenant leaving the Joint Tenancy: 
ii.    when a Tenant is leaving a Joint Tenancy and a new Tenant is being added to a Joint 
Tenancy and the Landlord has no claim against the Deposit for the Tenant leaving 
the Joint Tenancy; 
iii.   when a new Tenant is being added to a Joint Tenancy only; or
iv.    when a Tenant is leaving a Sole Tenancy and being replaced by another Tenant and 
the Landlord has no claim against the Deposit for the Tenant leaving the Tenancy.
b.  Landlords will be able to add or remove Tenants from a Tenancy via their online account.

II. The Statutory Declaration Process

a Statutory Declaration making a claim for all or part of the Deposit. This must be at 
least 14 Calendar Days after the Tenancy has ended.

relating to it (including a calculation);
iv.    confi rmation of whether the Statutory Declaration is being made on the basis that:
 1.    the  Party  making  the  claim  has  no  current  address  for,  or  other  means  of 
contacting the other Party. In this case the claiming Party must give details of any 
address (other than the Property) and other contact details (including telephone 
numbers or email addresses) which they have for the other Party; or
 2.    the other Party has failed to respond to the claiming Party’s written notice in 
relation to the distribution of the Deposit within 14 Calendar Days. In this case a 
copy of the written notice sent to the other Party must be attached.
v.   any information the claiming Party has as to the whereabouts of the other person;
vi.    confi rmation  that  the  claiming  Party  gives  their  consent  for  the  Dispute  to  be

or part of the Deposit as claimed; and

knowingly and wilfully make a false declaration, they may be liable to prosecution 
under Section 6 of the Perjury Act 1911.
III. Statutory Declaration Process – Statutory Declaration Notice and Resolution
a.  Once we have received a properly completed Statutory Declaration which meets the 
above requirements, we will issue a Statutory Declaration Notice and a summary of 
the claim to the other Party’s registered address, asking them to indicate within 14 
Calendar Days of receipt:
i.     whether  they  accept  that  the  claiming  Party  should  be  paid  the  whole  of  the 
amount claimed;
ii.    whether they accept that the claiming Party should be paid part of the amount 
claimed and if so, how much; and
iii.    if they do not accept that the claiming Party should be paid the whole of the 
amount  claimed,  whether  they  consent  to  the  Dispute  being  resolved  by  our 
Dispute Resolution Service. We will also, where possible, send notifi cation that a 
postal notice has been issued by email or SMS.
b.  The Party who receives the Statutory Declaration Notice must complete and return to 
us the Statutory Declaration Notice so that we receive it within 14 Calendar Days of 
when we issued it (the Statutory Declaration Notice deadline). They must also indicate 
their responses to a. (i) – (iii) above. If we do not receive the completed Statutory 
Declaration Notice within the Statutory Declaration Notice deadline, we will release 
the full amount claimed to the claiming Party within 10 Calendar Days of the Statutory 
Declaration Notice deadline.
c.  If the receiving Party completes and returns the Statutory Declaration Notice so that 
we receive it within the Statutory Declaration Notice deadline and confi rming that they 
agree that the whole or part of the amount claimed should be paid to the claiming 
Party, we will pay any agreed amount to the claiming Party within 10 Calendar Days of 
the date when we receive the Statutory Declaration Notice.
d.  If the other Party completes and returns the Statutory Declaration Notice so that we 
receive it before the Statutory Declaration Notice deadline and confi rming that they 
do not agree that the claiming Party should be paid all or any of the amount claimed, 
we will inform the claiming Party that their claim has been rejected wholly or in part 
and we will provide a summary of the other Party’s Statutory Declaration Notice.
e.  Once we have issued the summary of the Statutory Declaration Notice to the claiming 
Party, they will have 7 Calendar Days from the date of issue to agree or disagree with 
its contents. The claiming Party should submit any extra evidence which they wish to 
be taken into account by this deadline. The other Party will also be given 7 Calendar 
Days’ notice that the Dispute will be referred to our Dispute Resolution Service, and 
can submit any fi nal evidence of their own within this time. If no response is received 
from the claiming Party or the other Party within 7 Calendar Days from the date of 
the summary of the other Party’s Statutory Declaration Notice, the Dispute will be 
referred to our Dispute Resolution Service in any event.

The Deposit Protection Service Custodial Terms and Conditions
f.   If  the  other  Party  completes  and  returns  the  Statutory  Declaration  Notice  so  that 
we receive it within 14 Calendar Days, but does not indicate whether they consent 
to the Dispute being resolved by our Dispute Resolution Service, we shall assume 
they consents to the use of our Dispute Resolution Service. Both Parties will then be 
informed that the Dispute has been referred to our Dispute Resolution Service as 
detailed in (e) above.
g.  We will then forward copies of the:
i.     Statutory Declaration;
ii.    Statutory Declaration Notice; and

20.   The Dispute Resolution Service
General rules for using our Dispute Resolution Service
a.  To use our Dispute Resolution Service, Landlords and Tenants must have completed 
a  repayment  Form  or  online  repayment  request  with  notifi cation  of  a  Dispute  or 
completed the Statutory Declaration Process. They must consent or be deemed to 
have consented to our Dispute Resolution Service and confi rm that they will be bound 
by the Decision.
b.  If  the  repayment  Form  or  the  online  repayment  request  has  been  completed 
incorrectly  or  if  any  of  the  mandatory  declarations  have  been  struck  out,  then 
the Dispute cannot be referred to our Dispute Resolution Service. In this case, we 
will direct those involved to pursue the Dispute through the courts. As detailed in 
section 24 below, we will continue to hold the Deposit until we receive a court order 
instructing us to repay it, or an instruction to repay it signed by both Parties.
c.  If  you  agree  to  use  our  Dispute  Resolution  Service,  you  may  not  withdraw  your 
agreement in the future.
d.  If either Party does not agree to use our Dispute Resolution Service to resolve the 
Dispute, they must resolve the matter by agreement or through the courts. The Party 
refusing to use our service must start the required court proceedings within 6 months 
of notifying us of their refusal. If they do not, we may award the disputed amount to 
the other Party.
e.  We will only send Disputes to our Dispute Resolution Service if both the Landlord and 
Tenants comply with these Terms and Conditions.
f.   Use of our Dispute Resolution Service does not remove the duty of one Party to pay 
the other any other amounts which are due and not subject to a Dispute.
g.  Use of our Dispute Resolution Service is free of charge except in circumstances set 
out in subsection p and section 25 below and except as to the Parties’ own costs. Each 
Party must bear any costs they incur through participating in the Dispute Resolution 
Service. We will not make any award to cover these costs.
h.  The  Landlord  and  Tenant  are  free  to  settle  the  Dispute  between  themselves  at 
any  point  during  the  Adjudication.  They  must  notify  us  of  their  agreement  to  do 
so by providing an instruction signed by both Parties. We will return the Deposit in 
accordance with the agreement when we receive the instruction.
i.  The Adjudicator can only make a Decision to award up to the value of the Deposit.
j.   If either Party does not comply with any of these Terms and Conditions, the Dispute 
may be rejected and the Deposit will be subject to repayment in accordance with 
these Terms and Conditions.
k.  We may decide in our absolute discretion whether a Party has complied with these 
Terms and Conditions and is eligible to participate or continue to participate in the 
Dispute Resolution process.
l.   A Dispute must not be the subject of an existing court action.
m. We will not deal with Disputes through the Dispute Resolution Service where, in our 
reasonable opinion:
i.     they relate to matters other than the return of the Deposit; and/or
ii.     either Party has indicated their intention to issue legal proceedings in respect of 
any of the issues raised in the Dispute; and/or
iii.    the issues raised have already been decided upon by a court;
n.  The Adjudicator may also reject Disputes which, in their reasonable opinion:
i.     are being pursued in an unreasonable manner;
ii.    are frivolous;
iii.    are vexatious; and/or
iv.     seek to raise matters which were previously decided by a similar dispute resolution 
process, or matters which, in the opinion of the Adjudicator, exceeds their jurisdiction.
o.  Landlords  and  Tenants  can  only  make  evidence  submissions  to  the  Dispute 
Resolution Team by post to the address set out in section 36, or by emailing disputes@
depositprotection.com. We must receive evidence submissions before 11:59:59 p.m. 
on the day of the previously advised deadline. We will not accept evidence received 
after this time.
p.  If  a  Dispute  relates  to  a  Tenancy  that  is  not  an  Assured  Shorthold  Tenancy,  we 
reserve the right to charge the Landlord a fee of £500 plus VAT, or 10% of the Deposit 
amount,  whichever  is  the  greater.  Where  possible,  we  will  deduct  this  from  any 
amount awarded to the Landlord as a result of the Decision. If there is no award to 
the Landlord, or the amount awarded does not cover the fee, the Landlord must pay 
us within 14 Calendar Days of our request for payment.
q.  We reserve the right to reject a request to use our Dispute Resolution Service if the 
tenancy is not an Assured Shorthold Tenancy or when the Deposit is £5,000 or more 
in amount.
21.  Repayment Request – Collection of evidence
a.  Upon receipt of a duly completed online Deposit repayment submission notifying 
us  of  a  Dispute,  we  will  write  to  both  the  Landlord  and  the  Tenant,  inviting  both 
Parties to submit their evidence in relation to the Dispute. The Landlord and Tenant 
must ensure that we are in receipt of their evidence within 14 Calendar Days of our 
invitation being issued; failure to do so could result in the Deposit being paid to the 
other Party contrary to the Landlord’s or Tenant’s intentions. 
b.  If the Landlord or Tenant does not wish to submit any additional evidence in support 
of their claim, the Landlord or Tenant must notify us in writing confi rming that they 
will not be submitting any additional evidence, within the 14 Calendar Days of our 
invitation being issued. 
c.  If, within 14 Calendar Days of the invitation being issued by us, the Landlord or Tenant 
fails to submit any evidence, or in the alternative confi rm in writing that they have no 
additional evidence to submit, we will release the disputed amount to the other Party 
within 10 Calendar Days of the deadline for the Parties’ response. 
d.  In the event that neither Party complies with the requirement of section c above, we 
will repay any disputed sum to the Tenant. 
22.  Dispute Evidence – the details
a. The Landlord’s evidence should include, but is not limited to the following:
i.      a statement of the precise issues which are in Dispute and the reasons for the 
amount of any Deposit claimed;
ii.    the signed check-in inventory and schedule of condition;
iii.    vacating instructions;
iv.    the signed check-out inventory and schedule of condition;
v.    a signed and legally-compliant written Tenancy Agreement;
vi.     a  schedule  of  the  cost  of  any  works  sought  to  be  deducted  from  the  Deposit 
together with estimates, invoices and receipts (produced by an independent or 
third party) and photographs if available;
vii.  a statement of the rent account, if relevant;
viii.   if housing benefi
 t has been paid, a letter from the Housing Benefi t Department 
stating when it will stop, or that it has stopped;
ix.     any other relevant information including photographs, DVDs, correspondence or 
receipts; and
x.     confi rmation  that  they  have  contacted  the  Tenant  and  provide  a  copy  of  any 
correspondence between them, or details of their discussions.
b. The Tenant’s evidence should include, but is not limited to the following:
i.      the reasons why the Tenant denies that the Landlord is entitled to the disputed 
amount; and
ii.     any other relevant information including photographs, DVDs, correspondence or 
receipts. 
c.  Any  photographs  or  digital  evidence  should  be  signed  or  a  statement  should  be 
attached signed by the Party providing them and showing the date on which they 
were taken.
d.  If either Party cannot provide any of the above evidence, they should explain to us 
why they are unable to do so. We will then exercise our discretion to decide whether 
to allow the Dispute to proceed to Adjudication.
e.  The Nominated Tenant must complete the Tenant’s evidence on behalf of all Joint 
Tenants named on the Tenancy Agreement.
f.  Following receipt of each Party’s evidence, we may request extra information or 
clarifi cation.
g.  It is the Landlord’s sole responsibility to send us a signed, valid Tenancy Agreement 
before we pass the case to the Adjudicator. If we do not receive a copy of the Tenancy 
Agreement,  we  will  still  pass  the  Dispute  papers  to  the  Adjudicator.  Claims  from 
Landlords who do not provide a valid Tenancy Agreement are likely to fail.
23.   The Adjudication
a.  Once the deadline has passed for evidence submission, we will provide the following 
to the Adjudicator:
i.      the Landlord’s evidence, Statutory Declaration or Statutory Declaration Notice;
ii.    the Tenant’s evidence, Statutory Declaration or Statutory Declaration Notice;
iii.    any extra evidence from the Landlord or the Tenant.
b.  If the Parties submit evidence after the Adjudicator has already reached a Decision, 
they will not be able to take any further evidence into consideration.
c.  Our Adjudicators are fair and unbiased, and make their Decision based solely on the 
evidence and Forms submitted. You should submit any evidence you feel supports 
your case when we ask you to. If you do not submit evidence when requested, the 
Adjudicator will not be able to consider it when making their Decision.
d. The Adjudicator may:
i.      make  any  necessary  enquiries  with  the  Parties  if  issues  or  queries  arise  when 
reviewing the evidence;
ii.     carry  on  with  the  Adjudication  even  if  either  Party  does  not  comply  with  these 
Terms and Conditions, or any instruction from the Adjudicator or us;
iii.     stop the Adjudication if it appears that the Dispute cannot be settled this way, or if

HOW TO RENT3
Assured shorthold tenancies
When you enter an assured shorthold tenancy – 
the most common type – you are entering into a 
contractual arrangement.
This gives you some important rights but also some 
responsibilities.
This guide will help you to understand what questions 
to ask, what your rights are, and what responsibilities 
you have. 
This will help you create a positive relationship with 
your landlord, but will also tell you how to get help if 
things go wrong.
Take your time to read documents and contracts 
carefully. When you rent a home, people sometimes 
expect you to make a quick decision, or to sign 
documents before you’ve had time to think 
about them.
You shouldn’t feel forced into a decision and it is 
important to understand the terms and conditions of 
any contract you are entering into.
Your landlord must provide you with a copy of this 
booklet, so use the checklist and keep it safe to 
protect yourself from problems at every stage.
Who is this guide for?
This guide is for people who are  
about to rent a house or flat on an  
assured shorthold tenancy. Most of it will equally 
apply if you are in a shared property but in certain 
cases your rights and responsibilities will vary.
The guide does not cover lodgers (people who 
live with their landlord) or people with licences – 
nor tenants where the property is not their main 
or only home.
Links
This guide is best viewed online 
as it contains hyperlinks.
If you are reading this on a computer or tablet, 
you can click on the links to go to other websites 
with more detailed information.
They are coloured and underlined like this.
On Android or Windows devices, links work 
better if  you download Acrobat Reader from

HOW TO RENT4
Before you start
Renting from a landlord or a letting agent?
 £How long do you want the tenancy for? 
You can ask for a tenancy to be any length 
between six months and seven years. This has to 
be agreed with the landlord.
 £What can you afford? Think about how 
much rent you can afford to pay: 35% of your 
take-home pay is the most that many people 
can afford, but this depends on what your 
other outgoings are (for example, whether you 
have children).
 £If you are entitled to Housing Benefit 
or Universal Credit you may get help with 
all or part of your rent. If you are renting from 
a private landlord you will receive up to the 
Local Housing Allowance (LHA) rate to cover 
or help with the cost of rent. Check with this 
online calculator to see if you can afford to 
live in the area you want. You should also look 
at this advice about managing rent payments on 
Universal Credit.
 £Which area you would like to live in 
and how you are going to look for a 
rented home? The larger the area where you 
are prepared to look, the better the chance of 
finding the right home for you.
 £Do you have your documents ready? 
Landlords and agents will want to confirm your 
identity, immigration status, credit history and 
possibly employment status.
 £Do you have the right to rent property 
in the UK? Landlords must check that all 
people aged over 18 living in their property as 
their only or main home have the right to rent. 
They will need to make copies of your documents 
and return your original documents to you.
 £Will you need a rent guarantee? Some 
landlords might ask someone to guarantee your 
rent. If you don’t have a guarantor, ask Shelter 
for help.
Ways to rent a property
Direct from the landlordThrough a letting agent
 ¢Look for landlords who belong 
to an accreditation scheme. Your 
local authority can advise you 
about accreditation schemes 
operating in your area. The 
National Landlords Association 
(NLA),the Residential Landlords 
Association (RLA) and the Guild 
of Residential Landlords run 
national schemes.
 ¢Find out what fees (and costs) you will be charged and 
when you need to pay them. By law, a breakdown of all 
fees should be clearly visible to you in the agent’s office 
and on their website. The Government has committed to 
banning letting fees to tenants but this has not yet come 
into force. You should discuss the letting fees with your 
agent if you think that they are too high.
 ¢What independent redress scheme is the agent a member 
of? Are they are member of a client money protection 
scheme? By law, this information should also be clearly 
visible to you. 
 ¢Reputable agents are often accredited through a 
professional body like ARLA Propertymark, NALS, RICS or 
UKALA. Look for the SAFEagent sign too.
 ¢Landlords and property agents cannot unlawfully 
discriminate against a tenant or prospective tenant on the 
basis of their disability, sex, gender reassignment, pregnancy 
or maternity, race, religion or belief or sexual orientation.
Watch out for scams!
Be clear who you are handing  
money over to, and why.

HOW TO RENT5
Looking for your new home
Things to check
 £Deposit protection. If the landlord asks for 
a deposit, check that it will be protected in a 
government approved scheme. Some schemes 
hold the money, and some insure it.
You may be able to access a bond or guarantee 
scheme that will help you put the deposit together. 
Contact your local authority for advice.
Alternative products such as deposit replacement 
insurance also exist, but you need to fully understand 
the cover they provide before signing up. For 
example you will still be responsible for paying for any 
damage to the property at the end of the tenancy.
 £Length of the tenancy. There is usually a 
fixed period of 6 or 12 months. If you want more 
security, you can ask for a longer fixed period. 
 £Children, smoking and pets. Check if there 
any rules about them, as well as for other things 
such as keeping a bike, dealing with refuse and 
recycling.
 £Bills. Check who is responsible for bills such as 
electricity, gas, water and council tax. You or 
the landlord? Usually the tenant pays for these. 
Advice on paying bills is available here.
 £Fixtures and fittings. Check you are happy 
with them, as it is unlikely that you will be able to 
get them changed once you have moved in.
 £Smoke alarms – and carbon monoxide 
detectors if you have solid fuel appliances. 
Check these are provided. If not, your landlord 
must install them. They could save your life.
 £Safety. Check that the property is safe to live in. 
Use the ‘How to Rent a Safe Home’ guide to help 
you identify possible hazards.
 £If the building becomes unfit to live in. 
Check that the tenancy agreement excuses you 
from paying rent should the building become 
unfit to live in because of, for example, a fire 
or flood.
Check who your landlord isHouses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs)
 ¢They could be subletting – renting 
you a property that they are renting 
from someone else. If they are 
subletting, check that the property 
owner has consented.
Find out who you should speak to if 
any repairs need doing.
 ¢Ask whether the property is 
mortgaged.
Landlords should let you know about 
this upfront, because you may be 
asked to leave the property if the 
landlord does not pay their mortgage 
payments.
HMOs are usually properties in which unrelated people 
share facilities such as the kitchen or bathroom.
Some HMOs must be licensed. Check that your landlord has 
the correct licence. Landlords of licensed HMOs / houses 
must by law give tenants a statement of the terms on which 
they live in the property.

HOW TO RENT6
When you’ve found a place
Check the paperwork
 £Tenancy Agreement. Make sure you have a 
written tenancy agreement and read it carefully 
to understand your rights and responsibilities. 
The landlord or agent usually provides one but 
you can request to use a different version. The 
government has published a model tenancy 
agreement that can be used.
If you have any concerns about the agreement, 
seek advice b efore you sign.
 £Inventory. Agree an inventory (or check-in 
report) with your landlord before you move in 
and, as an extra safeguard, make sure that you 
take photos. This will make things easier if there 
is a dispute about the deposit at the end of the 
tenancy. If you are happy with the inventory, 
sign it and keep a copy.
 £Meter Readings. Remember to take meter 
readings when you move in. This will help make 
sure you don’t pay for the previous tenant’s bills.
 £Contact details. Make sure that you have the 
correct contact details for the landlord or agent, 
including a telephone number you can use in 
case of an emergency. You are legally entitled to 
know the name and address of your landlord.
 £Code of practice. Check whether whoever 
is managing the property is following a code of 
practice.
The landlord must provide you with:
 ¢A copy of this guide How to rent: The checklist for renting in England either as a hard copy or, 
if you agree, via email as a PDF attachment.
 ¢A gas safety certificate. The landlord must provide one at the start of the tenancy and within 
28 days of each annual gas safety check, if there is a gas installation.
 ¢Deposit paperwork. If you have provided a deposit, the landlord must protect it in a government 
approved scheme within 30 days and provide you with prescribed information about it. Make sure 
you get the official information from your landlord, and that you understand how to get your money 
back at the end of the tenancy. Keep this information safe as you will need it later.
 ¢The Energy Performance Certificate. This will affect your energy bills and the landlord must 
provide one (except for Houses in Multiple Occupation). Properties let on tenancies entered into after 
1 April 2018 must have an EPC rating of at least ‘E’ (unless a valid exemption applies).
If your tenancy started or was renewed after 1 October 2015 your landlord cannot evict you with a Section 
21 notice (no fault eviction) if they have not provided you with these documents. You can still be evicted with 
a Section 8 notice if you break the terms of your tenancy.
The landlord should also provide you with:
 ¢A record of any electrical inspections. All appliances must be safe and checks every 5 years  
are recommended.
 ¢Evidence that smoke alarms and any carbon monoxide alarms are in working order at the 
start of the tenancy. Tenants should then regularly check they are working.

HOW TO RENT7
Living in your rented home
The tenant must...
 £Pay the rent on time. If you don’t, you 
could lose your home because you have broken 
your tenancy agreement. If you have problems, 
GOV.UK has links to further advice. Check out 
these practical steps for paying your rent on time.
 £Pay any other bills that you are responsible 
for on time, such as council tax, gas, electricity 
and water bills. If you pay the gas or electricity 
bills, you can choose your own energy supplier.
 £Look after the property. Get your landlord’s 
permission before attempting repairs or 
decorating. It’s worth getting contents insurance 
to cover your possessions too, because the 
landlord’s insurance won’t cover your things.
 £Be considerate to the neighbours. 
You could be evicted for anti-social behaviour 
if you aren’t.
 £Not take in a lodger or sub-let without 
checking whether you need permission from 
your landlord.
And also you, the tenant, should...
 £Make sure you know how to operate the 
boiler and other appliances and know where the 
stopcock, fuse box and any meters are located.
 £Regularly test your smoke alarms and carbon 
monoxide detectors – at least once a month.
 £Report any need for repairs to your 
landlord. There will be a risk to your deposit if a 
minor repair turns into a major problem because 
you did not report it.
 £And don’t forget to register to vote.
The landlord must...
 £Maintain the structure and exterior of 
the property.
 £Fit smoke alarms on every floor and carbon 
monoxide alarms in rooms with appliances 
using solid fuels – such as coal and wood – and 
make sure they are working at the start of your 
tenancy. If they are not there, ask your landlord 
to install them.
 £Deal with any problems with the water, 
electricity and gas supply
 £Maintain any appliances and furniture they 
have supplied.
 £Carry out most repairs. If something is not 
working, report it to your landlord or agent as 
soon as you can.
 £Arrange an annual gas safety check by a 
Gas Safe engineer (where there are any gas 
appliances).
 £Give at least 24 hours notice of visits for 
things like repairs – the landlord cannot walk in 
whenever they like.
 £Get a licence for the property if it is a 
licensable property.
 £Ensure the property is at a minimum of 
EPC energy efficiency band E (unless a valid 
exemption applies).
And also the landlord should...
 £Insure the building to cover the costs of any 
damage from flood or fire.

fixed period, there are a number of important issues to 
consider. Check Shelter’s website for ad vice.
 £Do you want to sign up to a new fixed 
term? There may be costs for this, particularly 
if you rent through an agent. If not, you will be 
on a ‘rolling periodic tenancy’. This means you 
carry on as before but with no fixed term – your 
tenancy agreement should say how much notice 
you must give the landlord if you want to leave 
the property – one month’s notice is typical. 
Shelter publishes advice on how you can end 
your tenancy.
 £Your landlord might want to increase 
your rent. Your landlord can increase your 
rent by agreement, or as set out in your tenancy 
agreement, or by following a procedure set out 
in law.
If you or the landlord want  
to end the tenancy
There are things that both landlords and tenants must 
do at the end of the tenancy:
 £Giving notice. It is a legal requirement for 
landlords to give you proper notice if they want 
you to leave. Normally, the landlord must allow 
any fixed period of the tenancy to have expired, 
and they must have given at least two months’ 
notice.
Your tenancy agreement should say how much 
notice you must give the landlord if you want to 
leave the property – one month’s notice is typical.
 £Return of deposit. Try to be present when 
the property is inspected to check whether any 
of the tenancy deposit should be deducted to 
cover damage or cleaning costs (a ‘check-out 
inventory’). If you do not agree with proposed 
deductions contact the relevant deposit 
protection scheme.
 £Rent. Make sure that your rent payments are up 
to date. Do not keep back rent because you think 
that it will be taken out of the deposit.
 £Bills. Do not leave bills unpaid. This might have 
an impact on your references and credit rating.
 £Clear up. Remove all your possessions, clean 
the house, take meter readings, return all the 
keys and give a forwarding address. Dispose 
of any unwanted furniture via a local collection 
service. The landlord is usually entitled to dispose 
of possessions left in the property after, typically, 
14 days. The landlord must let you know, or try 
to let you know, that they intend to dispose of 
possessions you leave behind.

HOW TO RENT9
If things go wrong
There are often legal protections in place for the most 
common problems that you may experience during the 
tenancy – the following links will tell you what they are 
or where to look for help:
 £If you have a complaint about a letting 
agent’s service and they don’t resolve 
your complaint, you can complain to an 
independent redress scheme. Letting agents must 
be a member of a government approved redress 
scheme.
 £If you are having financial problems, 
or are falling into rent arrears, speak to your 
landlord as they may be helpful, and are likely to 
be more sympathetic if you talk to them about 
any difficulties early on. Should you need further 
help contact your local housing authority, Citizens 
Advice or Shelter as soon as possible. Check 
out these practical steps for managing your rent 
payments.
 £If the property is in an unsafe condition 
and your landlord won’t repair it – contact 
your local authority. They have powers to make 
landlords deal with serious health and safety 
hazards.
 £If you have a serious complaint about 
the property and your local authority has sent 
a notice to the landlord telling them to make 
repairs, your landlord cannot evict you with 
a Section 21 notice (no fault eviction) for six 
months after the council’s notice. You can still be 
evicted with a Section 8 notice if you break the 
terms of your tenancy.
 £Failure to comply with a statutory notice 
is an offence, local authorities may prosecute 
or fine the landlord up to £30,000. 
 £Local authorities have powers to apply 
for banning orders which prevent landlords or 
property agents letting out property if they are 
convicted of certain offences, including failure to 
comply with a formal notice issued by the local 
authority requiring safety improvements and 
making illegal evictions. If a landlord or property 
agent receives a banning order, they will be 
added to the database of rogue landlords and 
property agents. Landlords or agents may also 
be added to the database if they are convicted of 
a banning order offence or receive two or more 
civil penalties within a 12 month period.
 £Unannounced visits and harassment from 
your landlord – contact your local authority, or if 
more urgent dial 999.
 £If you are being forced out illegally, 
contact the police and your local authority. If 
your landlord wants you to leave the property, 
they must notify you in writing, with the right 
amount of notice – you can only be legally 
removed from the property with a court order.
If you live with your partner and you separate, you may have the right to carry on living in your home.
If you are concerned about finding another place to live, then contact the Housing Department of your 
local authority s traight away.
Depending on your circumstances, they may have a legal duty to help you find accommodation and they can 
also provide advice.
Local authorities have legal duties to help people who are threatened with homelessness within 56 days or 
are actually homeless.
The local authority should not wait until you are evicted before taking action to help you.
